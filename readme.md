A occult themed Roguelike.

# Plot

Welcome gunslinger, looks like a damn fine day to get ourself dirty with some of the occults finest.

We're tasked by Newtonicon to clear out their science lab and get rid of some... uhm... unfortunate experimental results.

I Guess dipping their toes in the occult sciences didn't work out as expected for them?
Or maybe it worked way better than expected and they couldn't handle it?! Anyhow, now it's our turn to descend onto level 9 of the lab complex and return the MacGuffin which is stilled installed there.
